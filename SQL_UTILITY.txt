The application has started in the background with the PostgreSQL database. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:
Successfully created the PostgreSQL database ventes_db
Updated the .env file with the correct database credentials
Successfully migrated all data from SQLite to PostgreSQL:
4,194 ventes records
1,080 stocks records
20 transferts records
Confirmed data integrity by querying the PostgreSQL database
Started the application with PostgreSQL as the backend
Your application is now running with PostgreSQL as the database system. This transition provides several advantages over SQLite:
Better support for concurrent connections
Improved performance for larger datasets
Advanced database features like complex queries and indexing
Better scalability for future growth
Support for network-based access to the database
The application should function exactly as before, but with the improved capabilities of PostgreSQL.
